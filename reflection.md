I consulted with Lucy, Zoe, Merry, and Ian for this assignment on Feburary 11 and Feburary 14. I went to TA hours with Lucy, Zoe, and Merry and was helped by Julia, Asher, and Dakota. 
Java was initially incredibly confusing. I am used to R and Python syntax, so having to declare everything was difficult to remember. But, I have learned to understand it better as I worked on the assignment. 
Programming languages are like Romantic languages. Some words and syntax are similar, but overall quite different. While knowledge of one language can help you learn another, it will still take an  incredibly amount of time and practice to become efficient in the language.
I definitely recommend working with others on this assignment. It is good to bounce ideas off each other. Additionally, students should start their assignment in TA hours. My VSCode would not load any Java project initially, so I was glad I had the TAs to help fix that problem.
